Will use glass to store data

Can store data in depth and angle (vector ?)

Could store for thousands of years

1975's superman movie is the first glass-stored 

Can support high temperature, humidity and scratch, the data is stored inside the glass (unlike CD wich are stored in surface)

# Writing practices

Storing data is an essential challenge, to match enormous amount of data all by reducing energy and ecological impact, by keeping availability and integrity.

Some of our data are stored in two differents method : 

- Hard drive
- SSD

But these way are ineffective the longer in years we go,
we thought of different storage support, such as glass and DNA, less available but effective to keep data over the year (glass can go up to 10'000 years).

Other concerns are ecological, how can we reduce heat in DC ? Some solutions consist to dive these DC under the ocean. 


---- Note
More way to store (experimental)
- DNA drive to store data
- Glass stored
