# ELIF mail

A regular computer works with electricity transported by wires. This electricity is used to trigger switches, either we have electricity or not, it is represented by 1 and 0.
On the other hand, quantum computer works with particules that replace the switches.

To make a comparaison, humain brain is like a runner, computer is like a car and quantum is like a rocket

## Second part

- It's not perfectly clear
- No decision has been made
- no agreement has been reacted (?)

## Third part

Fears "Q-Day"
